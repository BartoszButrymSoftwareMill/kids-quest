# KidsQuest

A simple web application that generates safe, short activity scenarios ("quests") for children aged 3-10 in seconds. KidsQuest helps parents and caregivers quickly move from "I don't know what to do" to starting an engaging activity by providing AI-generated or manually created quests tailored to the child's age, available time, location, energy level, and available props.

## Project Description

KidsQuest is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) web application designed for Polish-speaking parents and caregivers. The application focuses on reducing decision friction by providing:

- **AI-powered quest generation** based on customizable parameters
- **Manual quest creation** for personal activity ideas
- **Quest management** with favorites, filtering, and completion tracking
- **Safety-first content policy** ensuring all activities are age-appropriate and safe
- **Quick preset options** for instant quest generation

### Key Features

- Generate quests for children aged 3-10 years (grouped as 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10 years)
- Customize by time (default 30 minutes), location (home/outdoor), energy level, and available props
- Each quest includes a hook, 3 steps, easier/harder variants, and safety notes
- User accounts with email/password and Google OAuth authentication
- Quest library with favorites, filtering, and completion tracking
- Content safety validation with hard-ban and soft-ban policies

### Business Goals

- **Start Rate ‚â• 75%**: At least 75% of generated quests are accepted and started
- **AI Share ‚â• 75%**: At least 75% of started quests come from AI generation
- **Zero incidents**: No hard-banned content in production

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mvp
   ```

2. **Use the correct Node.js version**
   ```bash
   nvm use
   # or
   nvm install 22.14.0 && nvm use 22.14.0
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Configuration

You'll need to configure the following services:
- **Supabase**: Database and authentication
- **Openrouter.ai**: AI model access for quest generation

Refer to `.env.example` for required environment variables.

## Database Setup

KidsQuest uses **PostgreSQL** via **Supabase** for data storage and authentication.

### Local Database Setup

1. **Install Supabase CLI**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   
   # Windows (via Scoop)
   scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
   scoop install supabase
   ```

2. **Start local Supabase instance**
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```
   
   This will start local Docker containers and apply all migrations automatically.

3. **Access Supabase Studio**
   
   Open your browser at `http://localhost:54323` to view tables, run SQL queries, and manage data.

4. **Copy connection details**
   
   After `supabase start`, copy the `API URL` and `anon key` to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
   ```

### Database Schema

The database consists of:
- **User tables**: profiles (with default preferences)
- **Quest tables**: quests, quest_props (many-to-many with props)
- **Dictionary tables**: age_groups, props, content_policy_rules
- **Telemetry**: events (90-day retention)

All tables are protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

üìÑ **Detailed schema documentation**: [`/supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md)  
üìã **Complete database plan**: [`/.ai/db-plan.md`](.ai/db-plan.md)

### Database Migrations

Migrations are located in `/supabase/migrations/` and applied automatically:

1. `20251011000001_create_types_and_enums.sql` - ENUM types
2. `20251011000002_create_tables.sql` - Table definitions
3. `20251011000003_create_indexes.sql` - Performance indexes
4. `20251011000004_create_functions_and_triggers.sql` - Functions and triggers
5. `20251011000005_enable_rls.sql` - RLS policies
6. `20251011000006_seed_reference_data.sql` - Dictionary data

**Useful commands**:
```bash
# Reset and reapply all migrations
supabase db reset

# Generate TypeScript types from database
supabase gen types typescript --local > src/db/database.types.ts

# View migration status
supabase migration list

# Stop local instance
supabase stop
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint code analysis
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
